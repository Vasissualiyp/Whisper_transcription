# Whisper_transcription
This is a code I use to transcribe long audio files using OpenAI's whisper

## Usage
First, install all necessary directories (pip: pydub, openai-whisper; ffmpeg package for your system)

Then specify the parameters you want in the `main.py` file (most importantly, your initial and final filenames, as well as the model you want to use)

Wait and PROFIT!
